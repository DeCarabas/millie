- Tail recursion, either implicitly or via a keyword of some kind.

- Jump lables: rather than encoding jump targets as instruction
  offsets, instead encode jump targets as indices into a jump table
  associated with the function. This will make it easier to use the
  bytecode as input to generating native code.

- Native code gen: translate the byte code to C

- Data types:

  - Tuples
  - Enumerated types
  - Arrays
  - Lists?
  - Records?
  - Union types?
  - Unit?

- Pattern matching

- Garbage collector

- Computed goto for inner bytecode loop ala

- Register Allocation

- Direct calls if the binding is already well known and no closure is required.

- Tuple elements have different sizes.
